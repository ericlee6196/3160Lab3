Problem 1:

sum = 0, x = 0
while x < 1000
	if x % 3 or x % 5 = 0
	add x to sum
	add 1 to x
print sum


Problem 2

start sum at 0, a = 1, b = 2
c = a + b
make list with 2
while c < 4000000
	if c is even
	add to list
	a becomes b
	b becomes c
	c becomes new a + new b
sum = add all values in array
print sum


Problem 6

set y, sumsquare, squaresum all to zero
while y <= 100
	add y squared to sumsquare
	add y to squaresum
	add 1 to y
square squaresum
print squaresum - sumsquare

problem 9

loop a from 3 to 1000
nested loop b from a + 1 to 999
	c^2 = a^2 + b^2
	square root of c
	if a + b + c is 1000
	print a * b * c

problem 16

function to split number
	make list
	while n > 0
		place last digit of n in list
		remove last digit of n
	return list

x = 2^1000
pass x to function
sum = numbers in list
print sum
